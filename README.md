# Lab 4: Transformations, Animations, and Git

## Part 1

This part is to be completed on your own. It should have:

- One animation (translation, rotation, and / or scale) triggered by a click
- One animation triggered by the first animation reaching a certain threshhold (e.g. something rotated 180 degrees).
- Overall, you must have at least one translation animation and one non-translation animation (i.e. rotation or scaling).

## Part 2

This part will be completed in someone else's repo. Pair up. Each partner should:

- Go to the other's repo.
- Clone the repo (`git clone repo-url`)
- Make a branch (e.g. `git checkout -b branch-name`)
- Add your surprise (a creature or character from a previous lab). Add the function and the function call that properly places the creature. You will probably need to add more parameters to your function for rotation and scale.
